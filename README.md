CNNs have broken the mold and ascended the throne to become the state-of-the-art computer vision technique. Among the different types of neural networks (others include recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short term memory (LSTM), artificial neural networks (ANN), etc.), CNNs are easily the most popular.

These convolutional neural network models are ubiquitous in the image data space. They work phenomenally well on computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, image recognition, etc.



Other Detail:

This project has been developed by Abhiroop Sarkar & Prateek Dutta for the purpose of institutional project. Further Model Deployement is on process.

Dataset can be shared on requirement basis for educational purpose only. Candidate with requirement can mail a by mentioning the designation and current role with proper identity card in attachment.

Thank You, Have a Nice Day!
